	           <ul></ul>
                 <p>I enjoy playing volleyball, mostly on weekend when there is no school works to do. 
	             The most popular game in FPS today is Valorant. I enjoy playing it with friends
	             and alone, but the sad thing is that I got hardstuck on silver ranking.
	             When the pandemic started I also started to learn how to skate, been learning from almost a year now,
	             but I barely know any new tricks. Hopefully, in the near future, I could skate in our park and meet new friends.
	             I'am also learning how to play the ukelele because of my bestfriend, so we both could jam while we relax in our spare time.I 
				 also enjoy dressing up in my room with my sister, it is kind of our bonding when our parents are not around.
